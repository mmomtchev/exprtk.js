# Probably soon
- Support returning vectors and/or multiple values from an expression
- Support strings
- Support custom functions - both JS and C++
- Support differential and integral calculus

# Unlikely without funding
- Cache-oblivious traversal of `scijs` strides
- Automatic transpiling of native JS functions to ExprTk expressions
